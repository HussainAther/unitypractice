# BrainVR
This app is a virtual study of the brain for STEMXR Outreach we hope to use in educating the youth about the brain, neuroscience, mental health, and general science in the hopes of raising awareness of the power and potential of VR 

## Key Strengths for the App
1. Social: Through this app, we seek to increase the awareness and understanding of mental illness and mental health in general. With an immersive format of virtual reality, we hope to let students see and understand in a real-time environment how the brains and psychology of people with mental illness may differ and, through an understanding of these issues and the ways the lives of those with mental illness are impacted, this platform can be used to educate, empower, and promote understanding and honesty in a safe environment for learning. Furthermore, through the inclusion of activities and games related to education of mental illness from the perspective of the brain, we hope to lower the bar for entry on understanding complex and esoteric topics in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) for high school students. 
2. Educational: Among STEM fields, neuroscience in particular has presented itself as an exciting field for studying the nervous system, human anatomy, and other parts of our own experience that make us who we are.  
3. Gamification : For entertainment purposes, anything (like learning) can be fun! With an app like this, we can treat learning like it's a game in a way to reward individuals for studying the brain.
